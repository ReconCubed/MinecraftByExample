MinecraftByExample [1.15.2]
==================
** Work in Progress **
Note - this currently uses "latest" Forge version instead of "recommended" Forge version, because very many of the mappings
  in the "latest" version are still obfuscated.  See `build.gradle`:<br>
`      mappings channel: 'snapshot', version: '20200225-1.15.1`<br>
`      minecraft 'net.minecraftforge:forge:1.15.2-31.1.18`<br>

The purpose of MinecraftByExample is to give simple working examples of the important concepts in Minecraft and Forge. If you're anything like me, a good code example is worth several screens of waffling explanation, and can very quickly explain the key concepts.  I also find it much easier to adapt and debug something that already works, than to have to synthesize something from scratch and spend hours trying to discover the missing bit of information I didn't know about.

I've tried to keep the code simple and obvious and to resist the urge to be clever. The examples might not be the most efficient or succinct implementation, I've deliberately left the optimization to you.

Each example is split up to be totally independent of all the others.  The only part of the code which is common to more than one example is the MinecraftByExample class.

If you want more information and explanatory text about the concepts, the following links might be useful:

  - [The Official Forge documentation][forgedocs] (parts of it are rather outdated but on the whole still very useful starting reference)
  - [Guide to how Minecraft works][greyminecraftcoder] (still being updated from 1.8 to 1.14.4+)
  - [Fabric Wiki][fabricwiki] (some of it is specific to the Fabric API, but a lot of useful general info too) 
  - [Forge modder support forum][Forge forum]
  - [McJty tutorials][McJty]
  - [Mr Crayfish Furniture Mod (lots of examples)](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/MrCrayfishFurnitureMod)
  - [Cadiboo's example mod](https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod) some great tutorials for when you're starting out
  
#### For earlier versions, see the relevant GitHub branch:
 - MBE for Forge 1.8: [1-8final][version1-8]
 - MBE for Forge 1.8.9: [1-8-9final][version1-8-9]
 - MBE for Forge 1.10.2: [1-10-2final][version1-10-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11: [1-11final][version1-11]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11.2: [1-11-2final][version1-11-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.12.2: [1-12-2final][version1-12-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.14.4: [1-14-4partial][version1-14-4] (partially updated only)

If you are updating from previous forge versions, you will probably find [this link][versionupdates] and [this link][versionupdates1-15] very helpful.  For better or for worse, MCP decided to rename a very large number of classes (eg all Blocks Blockxxx --> xxxxBlock, etc) so this might save you a stack of time.
If you use IntelliJ, you might find these [xml mapping files][mapfiles] useful too

## List of examples

** examples marked with "x" haven't been converted yet **

### Blocks
  - [MBE01][01] - a simple cube
  - [MBE02][02] - a block with a more complicated shape
  - [MBE03][03] - two types of blocks which vary their appearance / shape:<br>
        a block (coloured signpost) with multiple variants- four colours, can be placed facing in four directions<br>
        a block (3D Web) with multiple parts (multipart) similar to a vanilla fence.
  - [MBE04][04] - a camouflage ("secret door") block which dynamically changes its appearance to match adjacent blocks - uses IBlockModel.getQuads(), ModelBakeEvent, IForgeBakedModel and IModelData  
  - [MBE05][05] - multilayer block (lantern block with transparent glass) with animated flame texture
  - X [MBE06][06] - several different types of block which use redstone
  - [MBE08][08] - how to add a creative tab for organising your custom blocks / items

### Items
  - [MBE10][10] - a simple item
  - [MBE11][11] - an item with multiple variants - rendered using multiple models and multiple layers
  - [MBE12][12] - an item that stores extra information in NBT, also illustrates the "in use" animation similar to drawing a bow
  - X [MBE13][13] - customise Mining behaviour of Blocks and Items - several test classes that show how mining works
  - X [MBE15][15] - a chessboard item with 1 - 64 pieces; uses ItemOverrideList.handleItemState(), IBlockModel.getQuads() and onModelBakeEvent()

### TileEntities
  - [MBE20][20] - using a tile entity to store information about a block - also shows examples of using NBT storage
  - [MBE21][21] - using the TileEntityRenderer to render unusual shapes or animations

### Containers (Inventories)
  - [MBE30][30] - a simple container for storing items in the world - similar to a Chest
  - [MBE31][31] - a functional container such as a Furnace or Crafting Table

### Recipes (Crafting/Furnace)
  - X [MBE35][35] - some typical example crafting recipes and furnace (smelting) recipes

### Heads Up Display/Overlays
  - X [MBE40][40] - simple customisations of the heads up display (hotbar, health meter)

### Commands
  - [MBE45][45] - custom commands

### Particles - particle effects
  - [MBE50][50] - shows how to use vanilla Particles; also how to generate your own custom Particles

### Network
  - [MBE60][60] - send network messages between client and server

### Configuration GUI
  - X [MBE70][70] - configuration file linked to the "mod options" button GUI on the mods list screen

### Testing tools
  - X [MBE75][75] - a tool to help you automate testing of your classes in-game.

### Entities and Models
  - [MBE80][80] - Shows the basics of Models (eg PigModel), model parameters adjustable in real time using commands
  
## Usage
  - You can browse directly in GitHub, or alternatively, download it as a zip and browse it locally.

  - If you want to install it and compile it, the basic steps for beginners are:
    1. Download the project as a zip.
    2. Unzip it to an appropriate folder on your computer, such as My Documents.  (Or, if you know how to fork a project on GitHub and import it into a local git repository, you can do that instead)
    3. Look at Forge's README.txt file in this folder and follow the instructions to import it into Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
    4. Use the gradle task runClient to run or debug the project.
